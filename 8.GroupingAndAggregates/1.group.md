# 8. Grouping and Aggregates

## Grouping Concepts

<br/>

Case: <br/>
you are in charge of sending coupons for free rentals to
your best customers.

<br/>

```
SELECT customer_id FROM rental;
// 16000 rows
```


```
SELECT customer_id
-> FROM rental
-> GROUP BY customer_id;
// 599 rows = total count of customer_id
```

```
SELECT customer_id, count(*)
-> FROM rental
-> GROUP BY customer_id;
// | id | count |
```

```
SELECT customer_id, count(*)
-> FROM rental
-> GROUP BY customer_id
-> ORDER BY 2 DESC;
// order by 2nd columns
```

```
SELECT customer_id, count(*)
-> FROM rental
-> WHERE count(*) >= 40
-> GROUP BY customer_id;
ERROR 1111 (HY000): Invalid use of group function


The group by clause
runs after the where clause has been evaluated.

You cannot refer to the aggregate function count(*) in your where clause, because the groups have not yet been generated at the time the where clause is evaluated
```

```
SELECT customer_id, count(*)
-> FROM rental
-> GROUP BY customer_id
-> HAVING count(*) >= 40;
// use having
```
