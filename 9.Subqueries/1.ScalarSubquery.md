# 9. Subqueries

## Scalar subquery

<br/>

A subquery returns single row and column.

<br/>

```
SELECT city_id, city
-> FROM city
-> WHERE country_id <>
-> (SELECT country_id FROM country WHERE country = 'India');
```

```
SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name
-> FROM customer
-> WHERE customer_id = (SELECT MAX(customer_id) FROM customer);
```

<br/>

## Multiple-Row, Single-Column Subqueries
<br/>

A subquery returns multiple rows in single column.

<br/>

Case: use in 'in' and 'not in' statement
``` 
select city_id, city 
  -> from city where country_id in 
  -> (select country_id 
  -> from country 
  -> where country in ('canada','mexico'));

select city_id, city
  -> from city
  -> where country_id not in
  -> (select country_id
  -> from country
  -> where country in ('canada','mexico'));
```

<br/>

Case: use with 'all'
<br/>
```
  // queries first and last names whose ID is not in subquery
  select first_name, last_name
    -> from customer
    -> where customer_id <> all
    -> (select customer_id
    -> from payment
    -> where amount = 0)

  //
  SELECT customer_id, count(*)
    -> FROM rental
    -> GROUP BY customer_id
    -> HAVING count(*) > ALL
    -> (SELECT count(*)
    -> FROM rental r
    -> INNER JOIN customer c
    -> ON r.customer_id = c.customer_id
    -> INNER JOIN address a
    -> ON c.address_id = a.address_id
    -> INNER JOIN city ct
    -> ON a.city_id = ct.city_id
    -> INNER JOIN country co
    -> ON ct.country_id = co.country_id
    -> WHERE co.country IN ('United States','Mexico','Canada')
    -> GROUP BY r.customer_id
    -> );
```

<br/>

Case: include 'NULL'
<br/>
```
   select first_name, last_name
    -> from customer
    -> where customer_id not in (122, NULL);

  // return empty
```
